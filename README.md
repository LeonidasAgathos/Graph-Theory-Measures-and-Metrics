# Graph-Theory-Measures-and-Metrics
Different metrics of Graph theory, applied in a public protein network. 

In this project, i imported a public protein network to make different measures and metrics. We discover measures such a as betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality,closeness centrality etc. You can find the public dataset following the link in the file "Public Dataset" in my repository. The measures and metrics applied into this project can be used in any graph without a problem, (for sure in 0-indexed graphs which i also used in the project) but anyone can try it in different graphs. There is plenty of help about the parameters of each measure in the official website of "NetworkX" library which is mainly used for this project. Feel free to use this project and contact me for any further information.
